 
Could I just bring my roaring trees with me? They give me all kinds of moods.
Everything takes place as quick as lightning with me - it is sometimes unbearable.
But this is not anything other than my impatient longing to hear from you - or read your words. 
Do you also sometimes have the feeling of not living, but to dream it all?
As if one had to tear strong invisible bonds to reach the real conscious life?

Imagine a life in one hundred years. A dream, not separable from real life. 
Everything would be intertwined.
I long to see you and feel You - now in this moment you seem almost 
like a fantasy creature. Are you fantasy, I am starting to wonder?
 
When I fetch the mail and there is no letter from you, I sometimes say: ‘the bad lazy Jo’ 
but I can not get an angry sound in my voice. No fantasy could procure this feeling.
You are not so easy to escape, you know that? - there are always Flames around you, 
either red hot tongues of fire, or even blue punitive ones - 
Olga and I warmed us in the red -never let the blue be directed against us.
 
How it pains me to know that you are fighting in the night with these ghosts that no one else can see. 

I am not complaining, if only I may keep what I am struggling for and those who are dear to me, 
I will forget about them roaring trees.

Just as your last letter, that answer gives you away just as you are. It was well written, that letter. 
Oddly, it is not written by an ugly woman - so wise it is.

You are the same to me whether you write or not write - you must only write when you are in the mood, 
not when I crave to hear from you which will be far too often, every day. 

Fantasy exists in its own world, with very few, if any links to the world I live in. 
I am not a product of your fantasy, that I know.
